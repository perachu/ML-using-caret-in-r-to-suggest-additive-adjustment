# ML-using-caret-in-r-to-suggest-additive-adjustment
visualize data-checking outlier and cleansing data then use caret to choose suitable model(random forest)
## 5 steps of this project
1) import dataset to R 
2) visualize dataset to understand characteristics of data
3) verify outlier and cleansing data
4) set up train-test-split function
5) training model(knn, rf, glmnet)
6) scoring and evaluate model
